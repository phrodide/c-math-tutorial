# Math tutorial

I have a friend that is practicing for his HiSET and asked for me to make a "Random Math Problem Generator"

Well, I don't know how far I'll get, but now you know why this is here.

## Problems

I intend to output in Markdown / Latex, but I'm finding out that there isn't any sure way to do this. In Vscode, the math problems show up fine, but if your markdown editor of choice doesn't support Latex, it looks like gibberish. One Markdown converter I found understand Latex, but outputs the problems very small.
